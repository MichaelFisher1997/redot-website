Full compatability with Godot allows to leverage everything Godot has, with the addition of getting more features and bugfixes that matter to the community (smaller voices get further reach).",

    body: "I think the Redot engine is a lot easier to use than other free engines, especially for someone who doesn't have a background in programming or tech. Installation is easy, and it's website was well organized and informative. It's definitely a good platform to make your first games on, and build yourself up as a developer. Redot can make wonderful 2D and 3D games already, and I'm extremely interested to see what new features they plan to implement for 3D in the future ( I'm planning on creating more into 3D style games in the future myself ). The community around the engine ( The discord, subreddit, etc . . . ) Are great places to hang out and talk to other people who have a passion for making games. I also appreciate how transparent Redot makes itself, and the professionalism of it's staff is top notch. Redot has seriously talented artist on it's creative teams, and extremely decorated senior developers building the engine up, and I know they put in a lot of time and effort into it. I'm really optimistic about this engine and it's brights future ahead!",
